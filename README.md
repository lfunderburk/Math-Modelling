# Math-Modelling
Repository containing various math modelling problems, along with Python code.

Note: I developed many of these modules as part of the [Callysto project](http://callysto.ca/), a federally funded program whose goal is supporting K-12 teachers and students by providing training and curriculum content which involves coding, math and computational thinking. 

If you wish to use any material developed as part of the Callysto project, please ensure you follow the terms of this [license](https://github.com/lfunderburk/Math-Modelling/blob/master/LICENSE.md).
